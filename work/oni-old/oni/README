= ONI - Object Network Interface

== Introduction

ONI is a RPC system implemented using
YAML on top of TCP/IP.
In the furture we may implement YAML
on top of HTTP.
YAML is quite suitable for the serialization of objects
required by remote object access protocols,
making short work of this, it is the primary benefit
that ONI has over SOAP and XML-RPC.

== Installation

To install simply unpack the gzipped tarball into your local site_ruby path.
This path is usually +/usr/local/lib/site_ruby/1.6/+.
An install script is not currently provided.

== Current Limitations

Currently ONI only works with Ruby, 
but it should be easy enough to 
generalize in the near future.
It is also very alpha, 
but nonetheless i have put it to work
under more realistic conditions and it looks promising.

== Note

I recently upgraded to Ruby 1.7 and Yaml 0.40.
Upon testing ONI in this enviornment execution speed
fell to a abnormal low. Something's wrong, but i'm not yet
sure where the problem lies. Please let me know how it runs on your system.

== Requirements

Ruby 1.6.7+
Yaml 0.40+

== Usage

For now, please refer to the example scripts, and rdocs.
